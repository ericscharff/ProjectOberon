# Project Oberon mirror

This is a mirror of the materials found at the
[Project Oberon 2013 Edition](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/ProjectOberon/index.html)
Web site. Project Oberon is a complete operating system written in Oberon-07.
The system is remarkably complete and self-hosting, with a GUI, compiler, and
upporting tools.

The targeted hardware platform is Nikalus Wirth's own creation, known as Risc5.
This platform is not to be confused with the RISC-V architecture, which is an
open ISA. The Risc5 here is a very simple RISC architecutre, simple enough to be
written and simulated on relatively simple FPGAs.

This repository exists in part because neither Wirth's web site nor the related
[projectoberon.com](http://projectoberon.com) does not provide any version
control. This is an attempt to keep history of various parts of the system.
