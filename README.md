# Project Oberon mirror

This is a mirror of the materials originally found at the
[Project Oberon 2013 Edition](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/ProjectOberon/index.html)
Web site. Project Oberon is a complete operating system written in Oberon-07.
The system is remarkably complete and self-hosting, with a GUI, compiler, and
supporting tools.

The target hardware platform is Nikalus Wirth's own creation, known as Risc5.
This platform is not to be confused with the RISC-V architecture, which is an
open ISA. The Risc5 here is a very simple RISC architecture, simple enough to be
written and simulated on a relatively simple FPGA.

This repository exists in part because neither Wirth's web site nor the related
[projectoberon.com](http://projectoberon.com) does not provide any version
control, nor is it clear how long Wirth's site will remain up. This is an
attempt to keep history for various parts of the system, and a snapshot in
case the original sites are removed.
