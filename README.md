# Project Oberon mirror

This is a mirror of the source code from the [Project Oberon 2013
Edition](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/ProjectOberon/index.html). This is the
source code for a complete operating system written in Oberon-07. The OS is
remarkably complete and self-hosting, with a GUI, compiler, and supporting
tools.

The targeted hardware platform is Nikalus Wirth's own creation, known as Risc5.
This platform is not to be confused with the RISC-V architecture, which is
an open ISA. The Risc5 here is a very simple RISC architecutre, simple enough
to be written and simulated on relatively simple FPGAs.

This repository exists in part because neither Wirth's web site nor the
related [projectoberon](http://projectoberon.com) does not provide any version
control. This is an attempt to keep history of various parts of the system.
