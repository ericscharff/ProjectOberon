Mirror of [Wirth's Oberon sources](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/) in
unmodified form.

These should be identical to the cleaned sources, but with the original line
endings (CRLF), etc.

A reconstruction of the Project Oberon PDFs is underway at
[tex-oberon](https://github.com/guidoism/tex-oberon). That project is using TeX
to create a clean PDF, and includes the sources for the full sytem. The source
of that project's source files is [Project Oberon](http://www.projectoberon.com)
which may not be identical to the sources here.
