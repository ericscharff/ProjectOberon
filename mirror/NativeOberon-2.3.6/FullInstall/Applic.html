<A NAME="0"></A>Introduction</H1>
A collection of applications, more precisely system extensions, is distributed with this release.
<BR>These applications are, in principle, contained in archive files located in the APPS sub-directory of your current Oberon System 3. If the latter is named "OBERON", use <CALL CMD="System.Directory C:/OBERON/APPS/* ~ "><FONT COLOR=FF0000>System.Directory C:/OBERON/APPS/* ~ </FONT></CALL> to list of them. Thus, in order to run them they must be installed first.
<P>In the following we shall:
<BR>
<UL>
<BR>
<LI>pass the applications in review
<LI>propose an installation procedure for running an application on a temporarily basis (look and feel) until it is discarded without leaving foot prints or until it is adopted as valuable system extension in your production environment.</UL>

<B>Components:  </B><CALL CMD="Desktops.OpenDoc ASCIITab.Arc"><FONT COLOR=FF0000>Desktops.OpenDoc ASCIITab.Arc</FONT></CALL>.
<P>You can use an ASCII character table to insert into documents extended characters not found on most <A HREF="Mouse.html#Keyboard">keyboards</A>. These include accented characters, appearing in some country alphabets, aswell as special characters provided in symbol fonts such as Math12.Scn.Fnt for example.
<P>
<A NAME="2"></A>This module's main function is to create a visual gadget representing a table of 8 rows by 32 columns containing the printable characters of the 256 8-bit combinations, as they are defined in Oberon. The visual gadget generator is ASCIITab.NewFrame. Inspection with Columbus, reveals that it has a <I>Name</I> and a <I>Font</I> attribute.

<A NAME="9"></A><B>Calc.List</B> - lists the functors (as a reminder or a help function), the value of pi and e, and the name and the value of the used defined variables.
<P>The next four commands all take an expression as argument. The syntax of the expression is defined by the following syntax:
<BR>
<PRE>
    Expr = Term {AddOp Term}.
    Term = Factor {MulOp Factor}.
    Factor = Atom {PowOp Atom}.
    Atom = Number | Functor Atom | ident | "(" Expr ")".

<A NAME="WTS"></A>Converter of Oberon V4 text file - WTS</H2>
<B>Components: </B> <CALL CMD="Desktops.OpenDoc WTS.Arc"><FONT COLOR=FF0000>Desktops.OpenDoc WTS.Arc</FONT></CALL>.
<P>Interesting Oberon extensions developed by users of the Oberon V4 system are regularly published and made available on quite a few FTP sites. If you wish to benefit of these developments aswell, here are the instructions for installing valuable Oberon V4 material on your System 3 system.
<P>Among the files that you may find in an FTP directory are a number of Oberon V4 text files. Since their names have the same <B>.Text</B> or <B>.Mod</B> extension as are used in System 3, there is no way to distinguish them at first sight. The *.Text files have been created with the V4 word processor and contain fonts, colors, pictures and other text control elements. The directory path or an eventual ReadMe file may however hint at V4. In any case you have to convert those text files with the WTS facility which is delivered as an <A HREF="Compress.html#">archived application</A> which must be installed first. Verify with <CALL CMD="System.Directory WTS* ~"><FONT COLOR=FF0000>System.Directory WTS* ~</FONT></CALL>
<P>
<A NAME="35"></A>The module WTS exports a single command which is documented in the <B>WTS.Tool</B> and is described below.
<P>
<A NAME="36"></A><B>WTS.Convert fileName [\[s][b]]</B> converts the named Oberon V4 text file to an Oberon System 3 text file. The fonts are also converted while the color and vertical offset of the text is retained. In addition, if the option <B>\s</B> is used the Elems included are converted to corresponding gadgets, that is:
<BR>
<UL>
<BR>
<LI>FoldElems to Outline gadgets (Outlines.New) using WTSFold.Mod
<LI>GraphicElems to their BasicFigures elements (line, rectangle, circle, spline) using WTS.Draw.Mod
<LI>PictElems to pictures (Pictures.NewPicture) using WTSPict.Mod
<LI>StampElems to TimeStamp gadgets (TimeStamps.New) using WTSStamp.Mod
<LI>ParcElems and StyleElems to TextStyle gadgets (TextGadgets.NewStyleProc). The source document may however not contain more than 48 (Text) styles.</UL>
<BR>If the option <B>\b</B> is used, the original file is renamed to a .Bak name.
<P><B>Exercise:</B>
<P>Access <B>"ftp://nuchem.nsrl.rochester.edu/pub/Oberon/B2Project/"</B>
<BR>and download (in binary) [Get ^] AnnualReport96.Text.
<P>then convert it with: <B>WTS.Convert AnnualReport96.Text\bs</B>
<P>and open the final document AnnualReport96.Text.
<P><B>Note:</B>  If you do not have a working V4, you can still download Postscript files from this directory. They describe the B2 project architecture, status, etc. 
<P>There is also an example of module to convert in:

<A NAME="38"></A>PolyWorlds</H2>
<B>Components: </B> <CALL CMD="Desktops.OpenDoc Win.PolyWorld.Arc"><FONT COLOR=FF0000> Desktops.OpenDoc Win.PolyWorld.Arc</FONT></CALL>.
<P>PolyWorlds is a tool for fast display of polygon worlds, i.e. three-dimensional scenes consisting only of polygonal surfaces.
<P>
<H3>
<A NAME="39"></A>Poly panel</H3>
A standard panel called "Poly.Panel" is provided which can be opened as a document in the
<BR>Gadgets environment of the Oberon System 3. On its right side is the currently displayed polygon world, on its left side are several standard interface elements.
<P>World Data
<BR>A list of available scenery files is located in the lower left corner. Clicking one of the entries with the middle mouse key (MM) will load and display the corresponding scene. On slower machines, you may have to wait for several seconds until the new scene gets drawn, depending on its complexity. The list of names is updated whenever the Show button is activated.
<P>World<B>
<BR>[Clear]</B> empties the current world.
<P><B>[Statistics]</B> prints the current number of shapes, points and polygons to the system log.
<P>The <B>Horizon</B> check box enables or disables the display of a horizon.
<P>View<B>
<BR>[Reset]</B> returns to the default view, where the observer is located at the origin, looking along the negative z-axis.
<P><B>[Align]</B> rotates the current view until the local coordinate system of the selected shape is aligned with the camera coordinate system. The local coordinate system is the coordinate space in which the shape was defined before being transformed to world space.
<P><B>[Benchmark]</B> shows a fixed sequence of camera views and prints the duration of the animation, in number of ticks and the approximate time in seconds, to the system log.
<P>Movements
<BR>Pressing the left mouse key (ML) inside the frame box where the world is displayed invokes the current navigator. The navigator will process mouse and keyboard inputs until the mouse key is released, mapping those inputs to changes of the current view. There are two navigators to choose from:
<P><B>[Planar]</B> is the default navigator and is active after opening the panel. As long as ML is pressed, the camera is rotated left and right according to horizontal mouse movements. Vertical mouse movements affect the current speed. The keyboard keys 'a' and 'z' move the observer up and down.
<P><B>[Flying]</B> activates a simple flight model. Mouse movements affect pitch and roll of a virtual airplane. Forward speed is controlled by the keyboard keys 'a' and 'z'.
<P>Field of View
<BR>The slider as well as the text field below may be used to modify the camera's focal distance, allowing to zoom in or out. The text field displays the opening angle in degrees of the camera's view frustrum.
<P>Clicking the right mouse key (MR) when the mouse arrow points at an object displayed in the current view selects the indicated object (also called shape). A new color for the selected shape may be chosen with a ColorPicker, and its attributes may be inspected and modified using Columbus. The model assigned to the shapes (and to the frame itself) may also be inspected and shows attributes not particular to a single object, such as sky and ground color.
<P>Some shapes possess an attribute "Cmd", which may be set to any Oberon command. The command is activated by clicking over the corresponding shape with the middle mouse key.
<P>
<H3>
<A NAME="40"></A>Creating Polygon Worlds</H3>

<BR>Polygon Worlds can be created using a simple text editor. PolyWorlds is distributed along with
<BR>several example scenes, which may serve as a tutorial introduction on scene generation. The following EBNF rules define the PolyWorlds grammar.
<BR>
<PRE>
Scene = {ShapeDef} {"clear"|"horizon" ("yes"|"no")|"ambient" number|ShapeCmd}.
ShapeDef = "shape" ident {"points" {Vector}} {"polygon" {number}|ShapeCmd} "end".
ShapeCmd = ("add" ident|"light" Vector number|Attribute).
Attribute =
        "color" number number number |
        "diffuse" number |
        "save" |
        ""restore" |
        "identity" |
        "matrix" Vector Vector Vector Vector |
        "translate" Vector |
        ""rotate" number Vector |
        "scale" Vector.
Vector = "(" number number number ")".
</PRE>
<BR>Comments start with "#" and reach until the end of the line.A more detailed description of the commands can be found in E. Oswald, PolyWorlds, Diplomarbeit am Institut f&#252;r Computersysteme, ETH Z&#252;rich, 1994.

<A NAME="41"></A>Snapshot tool</H2>
<B>Components: </B> <CALL CMD="Desktops.OpenDoc Win.Snapshot.Arc"><FONT COLOR=FF0000>Desktops.OpenDoc Win.Snapshot.Arc</FONT></CALL>.
<P>A snapshot captures the bitmap contained in the specified Oberon display frame (a viewer, a document, a visual gadget or even the entire screen) and transforms it into a picture object displayed in a Rembrandt frame. Its facilities are very useful for documenting Oberon system extensions. However, you should rather insert active documents in your documentation (Desktops.InsertDoc docName), instead of captured, static pictures. Snapshot is an extension of the Rembrandt tool.
<P><B>Warning:</B> Remember that the desktop has four quadrants: if the captured frame is not entirely visible on the current quadrant, the picture will be blurred.
<P>
<H3>
<A NAME="42"></A>Snapshot commands</H3>
The following three commands are used to make a snapshot of the marked visual object.
<P>
<A NAME="43"></A><B>Snapshot.Viewer *</B> opens a Rembrandt document named "Snapshot" displaying a snapshot of the marked viewer.
<P>
<A NAME="44"></A><B>Snapshot.Document *</B> opens a Rembrandt document named "Snapshot" displaying a snapshot of the marked document.
<P>
<A NAME="45"></A><B>Snapshot.Gadget *</B> opens a Rembrandt document named "Snapshot" displaying a snapshot of the marked gadget.
<P>The next three commands are used to insert a snapshot of the marked visual object at the caret.
<P>
<A NAME="46"></A><B>Snapshot.InsertViewer *</B> inserts a Rembrandt frame displaying a snapshot of the marked viewer at the caret.
<P>
<A NAME="47"></A><B>Snapshot.InsertDocument *</B> inserts a Rembrandt frame displaying a snapshot of the marked document at the caret.
<P>
<A NAME="48"></A><B>Snapshot.InsertGadget *</B> inserts a Rembrandt frame displaying a snapshot of the marked gadget at the caret.
<P>The last two commands are used to make a snapshot of the entire Oberon screen.
<P>
<A NAME="49"></A><B>Snapshot.Screen</B> opens a Rembrandt document named "Snapshot" displaying a snapshot of the entire screen. No color mapping is performed to ensure correct colors in the picture generated.
<P>
<A NAME="50"></A><B>Snapshot.Screen2</B> opens a Rembrandt document named "Snapshot" displaying a snapshot of the entire screen. The colors are mapped to the current Oberon palette and the palette is stored with the picture.

<P>at the beginning? Only the second has a meaning!
<P>- Inspectors.Arc:
<BR>   Libraries.Mod and Libraries.Panel must be renamed to avoid conflict with new version.
<BR>   New version must not be named Libraries2.
<P>- Poly.Arc:
<BR>   What is GPakToPoly in TestEyePoly???
<P>- Snapshot.Arc:
<BR>   What is Snaphot.Screen2 in Win.Snapshot.Mod? Not documented in Snapshot.Tool.
<P>- PolyWorld.Arc:
<BR>   PolyWorlds.Text refers to the Inspector: replace by a reference to Columbus.
<BR>   There is no Directory button but a Show button in the panel.
<P>- Hex.Arc:
<BR>   Wrong, old components are deleivered (Hex.Mod and Hex.Tool).
<BR>   The new Hex.Mod also requires module ListRiders, which is not there!!
<P>- Win.EditTools.Arc:
<BR>   Win.FontRes.Mod imports Log which is in Log.Arc. !!!
<BR>   Which component is only applicable to Windows?
<BR>   Win.FontRes.Mod or/and FontEditor.Mod????<BR>Installed on 14 Feb 1997<HR></BODY>
