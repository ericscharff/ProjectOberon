# NativeOberon-2.3.6-Extracted
Files from Native Oberon 2.3.6 extracted and converted to be readable on a modern OS

## Sources

[Native Oberon Files on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nativeoberon/files/nativeoberon)

Oberon System3 at ETH Zurich FTP: `ftp://ftp.ethoberon.ethz.ch/Oberon/System3/`

## Extracted

`DownloadedImages` contains the installation images, just as downloaded (for preserving them).

`FullInstall` contains the contents of the disk after doing a full installation

`FullInstall_ASCII` contains those files (where it makes sense) converted from Oberon Text to (unformatted) ASCII text

`FullInstall_Pictures` contains pictures converted from Oberon Pict to GIF


`Oberon0Disk` and `Oberon0Disk_ASCII` contain the same, but for the installation floppy and not the installed system.
