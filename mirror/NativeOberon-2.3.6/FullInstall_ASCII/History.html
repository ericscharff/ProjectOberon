Lack of manpower for porting projects also restrict these efforts.<LI> The main difference is that Native Oberon is a full operating system, which is in complete control of the machine.  In contrast the Windows and Mac versions run as applications on host operating systems.  This has obvious advantages and drawbacks.<LI> Native Oberon has modest machine requirements (see end of this page).<LI> It only supports a small subset of available PC hardware.  Using drivers for other operating systems (in a clean way) is not possible, because they are tightly coupled with their host operating system.  Drivers for Native Oberon are written in Oberon and assembly language (an assembler is integrated in the compiler).<LI> Differences with older versions of Oberon System 3 are mainly in the Gadgets modules, which have evolved quickly in the past few months.<LI> Some low-level interfaces (e.g. Kernel) also changed, but as few programmers use these non-portable modules, the effect is not too disasterous.<LI> Development of Native, Windows and Mac Oberon continue independently (the latter at the University of California at Irvine, in cooperation with ETH, and the former two at ETH).  Therefore some experimental features, e.g. self-contained documents, are not supported equally in these three versions.  The Omega code (aka OMI), which forms the basis of Juice, is being ported to Native Oberon.</UL>New features:<UL><LI> Net tools updated.  Note that the new mailbox format is incompatible with the old.  Use Mail.Convert oldmailbox newmailbox to convert.  See Network.Tool. (Thanks Emil Zeller).<LI> Gadgets updated.

This means that Kernel.GetTimer, Input.Time and Oberon.Time now return the time in microseconds.<LI> Kernel interface cleanup.  Kernel.RemoveIP now also takes the name of the interrupt handler to deinstall.  Kernel.NewDMA is provided for allocating memory for DMA.  Kernel.Copy, Kernel.SetTimeout, Kernel.Expired, Kernel.GetCMOS removed.<LI> Mouse type 4 is an alternate Mouse Systems driver, for the cases where the type 1 driver does not work.<LI> Pressing Ctrl-Break twice will perform a "hard" break, to break out of any loop.  The old distinction between soft and hard breaks (Ctrl-Break & Ctrl-Alt-Break) is no longer made.  Ctrl-Alt-Del can also be used as reboot.<LI> A very basic Mitsumi CD driver is now available.  Pause/Resume is not implemented.<LI> GadgetsIn and GadgetsOut modules simplify I/O.<LI> Tetris, Scramble and Sokoban games now available.<LI> HP500 printer driver now included.<LI> Texts.Scan now treats objects as whitespace instead of scanning them as arbitrary characters.<LI> More than 255 objects may now be stored in a text.

System.DarkPalette and Gadgets.Hardlook options added in Oberon.Text for compatibility with Windows/Mac Oberon.<LI> SoundBlaster driver, .wav and .au player/recorder (thanks Thomas Burri).<LI> Scavenger added to install disk for rebuilding damaged directories.  After Config.Disk, use Scavenger.Scan, Scavenger.Display and Scavenger.WriteDirectory in this order, but only in case of emergency.  Deleted files may also re-appear if their disk space have not be re-used.<LI> New V24 module, with 16550 support.  Interface cleaned up.  Same interface will be implemented in Windows Oberon.<LI> Password handling integrated in NetSystem.  NetSystem.user & NetSystem.passwd removed.  Use NetSystem.GetPassword instead.  Passwords module removed.  NetSystem.Start no longer required, instead use NetSystem.SetUser to set a password.<LI> More information in System.ShowModules, System.Directory, System.ShowLibraries and System.Watch.  System.Free ^ now also works.<LI> Miscellaneous.PrintFiles implemented for sending files uninterpreted to printer.<LI> Printer.Open now takes a second "options" parameter for specifying options.<LI> Fast file system startup.  File system GC is now only performed at startup when less than x% of the disk is free.  x is 10 by default and is configurable with the DiskGCThres config string.  Warning: If you alternately use old and new versions of Oberon on the same file system, set DiskGCThres=100, otherwise the old version may damage the new version's file system.<LI> New feature for tracing.  HALT(MAX(INTEGER)) will produce a trap viewer, but execution continues after the HALT.<LI> Gadget layout language (LayLa) for defining Gadgets (thanks J&ouml;rg Derungs).<LI> LCPanels example module for defining Gadgets with layout constraints.<LI> Visual catalog of Gadgets.

The driver has not been tested with the new distribution.<LI> LEDA publishing system is now available as a package.<LI> Installation process cleaned up and simplified.</UL>Errors fixed:<UL><LI> There is a typo in section 2.1 of install.txt.  Instead of entering ".dsk", you should enter "oberon0.dsk" at the rawrite prompt (fixed).<LI> The ET4000 driver is missing from the release (found by Peter Matthias).  It is now available in the beta directory.  To install it, first install with the VGA driver, then write the ET4000 driver to a DOS floppy and read it into Oberon with a Backup.ReadFiles command.  Then rename it to ET4000.Display.obj and boot Oberon-0 to reconfigure the display in section 4 of Install.Tool.  The driver will be present in the next release (fixed).<LI> The INSB, INSW and INSD instructions are assembled incorrectly.  Use DB to define the instruction explicitly as a temporary workaround (fixed).<LI> A complex expression with SYSTEM.VAL causes compiler trap (found by Wolfgang Ibl, fixed).<LI> The disk driver may trap with error = 6013 on very slow machines (found by Peter Matthias, fixed).<LI> If an extended partition contains deleted logical drives, the Disk module and Install tool can't handle it (fixed).<LI> There is a small problem with the left and right arrows in the ET editor when at the start or end of a text (found by Patrik Reali, fixed).<LI> Oberon.GetSelection returns an undefined text when no selection is active (found by Josef Templ, fixed).<LI> Assembler errors: MOV AX,SS; MOVSW; MOV CR3,EBX; INSB/W/D; JE 128; JE -129; JMP Rel16 (fixed by Patrik Reali)<LI> TextHyperlink in Gadgets.Panel does not exist.  An alias "TextHyperlink = TextGadgets.NewControl" is missing in Oberon.Text (found by F.Necati Ecevit, fixed).<LI> The EtherNet module is not in Network.Arc, but in Develop.Arc! (fixed)<LI> Assembler errors: RET imm16, CALL Rel16, LEA Reg32,M16, const size (fixed by Patrik Reali).<LI> Compiler: CHR/ORD do not accept SYSTEM.BYTE (fixed by Patrik Reali).<LI> The information in section 5 of install.txt is incorrect.  Instead of "Video=3", it should say "Init=" (fixed).<LI> The PostScript Printer module's Picture procedure could overflow on large pictures (found by Peter Matthias, fixed).<LI> There is an error in the Ports module of the net system (fixed by Martin Gitsels).<LI> Gadgets does not display error message when module loading fails (found by F.Necati Ecevit, fixed).<LI> Miscellaneous.Snapshot does not work (fixed by Harry Lewis - Tseng/VGA only).<LI> The 3Com Ethernet driver does not work if an AUI port and external transceiver is used (fixed).<LI> Sisiphus is not working because data file is missing (fixed).<LI> When creating the first partition on a drive, the partition does end on a cylinder boundary (fixed).<LI> OBL does not allow set strings which only differ in the last character (fixed).<LI> If a drive has deleted logical drives on it, the partition table reading code could trap (fixed).<LI> The 3Com EtherNet driver does not work with twisted-pair networks (fixed).<LI> Only 60 NewPatterns could be defined in the Display module (fixed).<LI> Errors in the Analyzer (fixed by Stefan Ludwig).<LI> Pressing F1/F2 at the same position leaves garbage on screen (fixed).<LI> Compiler/Builder does not always display correct module name (fixed).<LI> Error in Outlines (fixed by Patrik Saladin).<LI> Install program does not support PartType config string (fixed).<LI> Home/End not mapped (fixed).</UL><H2><A NAME="R206">Release 2.06, March 28, 1996</A></H2>Notes:<UL><LI> Stack clearing is on by default with the new compiler.  This means that programs will run slower, but safer, because the run-time system can not be corrupted by uninitialised pointers.  Currently all local variables are initialised for this purpose.  This code will be optimised later to only initialise pointers [done in release 2.2.6].<LI> When installing version 2.06 over an existing version (2.04 or 2.05), the boot loader has to be updated.  Use the Install.InitBootLoader command in section 2 of Install.Tool.  Re-initialising the file system with Install.InitFileSystem is optional.  Executing the latter will wipe all existing Oberon files.  That is why the Install program has an "Unsafe" mode! (found by Peter Matthias).<LI> The compiler does not recognise the Oberon-2 extensions: read-only export and type-bound procedures.<LI> The floating-point emulator does not work with the new compiler, so a processor with floating-point coprocessor is required [done after release 2.2.6].</UL>New features:<UL><LI> Oberon.OptionChar is now "\" and "/" characters are allowed as part of a Text.Name.  This is for consistency with the Windows and Mac versions of Oberon System 3, and for compatibility with URLs.  Use Oberon.OptionChar in code instead of "\".<LI> The Ctrl key is now used (instead of Alt) to emulate the middle mouse button with two-button mice.  This is for consistency with the Windows and Mac versions.  Both Ctrl keys can be used, which is more friendly to lefties!<LI> System.Trap now uses the in-memory reference block and no longer requires the presence of the .obj files.  It is also faster.<LI> Stefan Ludwig's Analyzer is now included.  See Analyzer.Tool in the basic system.  The compiler no longer displays any warnings.<LI> The mouse driver now has a speedup option.  If the mouse is moved faster than a certain threshold rate, the cursor moves at a faster rate than the mouse.<LI> Francis Bogsanyi's ATAPI CD audio driver is now available, as well as Emil Zeller's Audio CD player.  See Audio.Tool.<LI> New command System.Reboot.  System.Quit now just stops all tasks and then waits patiently for the machine to be shut off.<LI> Then Install tool now gives a warning and a second chance before overwriting an existing installation.<LI> New installation procedure with only one boot floppy.  This is must more convenient when installing from the net.<LI> Object files and symbol files now have the extensions .obj and .sym respectively.  This is only a temporary measure so that version 2.04 and version 2.06 can co-exist on the same disk.<LI> The Linker was renamed to BootLinker to avoid a name conflict.<LI> Boot loader more user-friendly.<LI> New Gadgets look.</UL>Errors fixed:<UL><LI> Hard break does not work well (fixed).<LI> There are several errors in the decoder (fixed).<LI> The VGA driver does not work well (fixed).<LI> The Install tool can only create new partitions at the end of the disk (fixed).<LI> Miscellaneous.GetObjSize does not work for the new format .obj files (fixed).<LI> Builder.MarkErrors does not work (fixed).<LI> Watson does not understand the assembler extension (fixed).<LI> Multiplication of an INTEGER with a SHORTINT/INTEGER constant (found by Peter Matthias, fixed).<LI> SYSTEM.LSH(shortint const, shortint const) now returns a longint (found by Peter Ryser, fixed).<LI> RealVar := ORD(AnyChar) (found by Erich Oswald, fixed).<LI> SYSTEM.PUT(x, NIL) now allowed (found by Andreas Disteli, fixed).<LI> Assembler-Functions could not be written (fixed).<LI> SETx - wrong opcode generated (fixed).<LI> the syntax [base + index * scale] and [index * scale + base] was not accepted (fixed).<LI> [index * 1] was not accepted (fixed).<LI> off[ESP] was wrong (fixed).<LI> jmp -130: the relative address was a 1-byte value (but needs 2-bytes!) (fixed).<LI> MOV RM16, SReg and MOV SReg, RM16  were wrong (fixed).<LI> MUL RMxx was not accepted (shortcut for MUL Accumulator, RMxx) (fixed).<LI> DIV RMxx was not accepted (shortcut for DIV Accumulator, RMxx) (fixed).</UL><H2><A NAME="R205">Release 2.05, February 10, 1996</A></H2>New features:<UL><LI> We have switched to a totally new compiler and assembler with this version.  It has not been tested extensively yet.  Only experienced Native Oberon users should install this version.<LI> An adapted version of the OP2 compiler with an inline assembler is used to build this release.  It includes an integrated assembler.<LI> A JPEG viewer is now available.  Just use Desktops.OpenDoc on a file with a .jpg extension.  The image/jpeg MIME type is now also supported by the WWW browser (Thanks ejz,du).<LI> All the gray keys are now mapped to key codes.  PgUp, PgDn etc. can be used in TextDocs.<LI> NumLock on by default.</UL>Errors fixed:<UL><LI> There is an error in FOR statement compilation for complex upper bound expressions (fixed).<LI> The Icon * button in the Documents.Panel does not work (found by Francis Bogsanyi, fixed).<LI> There is an error with constant floating point expressions (fixed by Andreas Disteli).<LI> Oberon20.Scn.Fnt and Oberon24.Scn.Fnt are missing (found by Peter Matthias, fixed).<LI> S3C805 Display module does not handle patterns wider than 32 pixels (found & fixed by Erich Oswald).<LI> The Lissajous.Panel is missing (found by Prof. Gutknecht, fixed).<LI> The Oberon-0 RAM disk was bigger than neccessary (fixed).<LI> The floppy driver did not work reliably on a PS/2 model L40SX (fixed).<LI> The mouse could be jerky with graphical editors (found by Erich Oswald, fixed).<LI> The 2.88M floppy on a DEC PC is not recognised (found by Michael Raps, fixed).<LI> Subnet broadcast addresses are not recognised in the net system (fixed by Martin Gitsels).<LI> Some .gif files can not be loaded (fixed by Emil Zeller).<LI> The PostScript printer does not recognise Oberon fonts (fixed).<LI> The source address on outgoing EtherNet packets is not set (fixed).</UL><H2><A NAME="R204">Release 2.04, January 13, 1996</A></H2>Errors fixed:<UL><LI> The brand new ET4000 driver was not included!  The file ET4000.Display.Obj is now available on the beta site.  Copy it to the Oberon file system and then re-run Oberon-0 to set up the ET4000 display (found by Wolfgang Ibl, fixed).<LI> The "Call error:" message from TextGadgets is displayed incorrectly (found by Peter Matthias, fixed).  New TextGadgets0.Obj available on huxley.<LI> There is an error in the FAT file system code.  It is not possible to install version 2.03 to a DOS file (found by Jon Trygve, fixed).<LI> There is a serious error in the Disk module.  The first 6 sectors of the partition after the Oberon partition could potentially be overwritten when the Oberon file system is full (found by Beat Christen, fixed).<LI> The ReadMe.Book contains a reference to Profiler.Book, which is not included (found by Thomas Burri, fixed).</UL><H2><A NAME="R203">Release 2.03, January 8, 1996</A></H2>New features:<UL><LI> Swiss keyboard support.<LI> Compatibility with the Ontrack disk manager from Maxtor.  Other disk managers may also work.<LI> System.ClearLog command replaced by System.Clear, which works on any TextFrame.  Default System.Log menu updated.<LI> NetSystem updated.  Errors in UDP, TCP & DNS were fixed & sending and receiving were speeded up.  NetSystem.SendData and ReceiveData were renamed SendDG and ReceiveDG.  Also, if you define "User" in the NetSystem section of Oberon.Text, and use the Passwords tool, it is no longer necessary to run NetSystem.Start.<LI> Gadgets updated.  The Links module was added.<LI> A lot of time has been spent by Hannes Marais to write Watson documentation for the module interfaces.  His documentation has been merged into the Native Oberon modules.<LI> The compiler now allows comparison of character constants with strings.  Some type checking errors were fixed.<LI> Compatibility with the 80387 coprocessor.  (Trap handling works differently).<LI> NetSystem updated again.  Counters were introduced to help with configuration debugging.<LI> The Find.Panel for searching for a string in files was added (Thanks Patrik & Thomas).<LI> Oberon.OptionChar added.<LI> Kernel interface was cleaned up.  GetEnv renamed to GetConfig.  TimeUnit for GetTimer exported.<LI> Asynchronous break (Ctrl-Alt-Break) made safer.  Will no longer interrupt the garbage collector halfway.<LI> File system sector size changed from 1k to 2k.  Largest file is now 12Mb.<LI> Mail.Panel Settings updated.

The values are taken from Oberon.Text instead.<LI> Optimised memory copy in Kernel, Files, NetSystem, EtherNet.<LI> Help procedures added to make Gadgets programming simpler.  Attributes: added GetBool, GetInt, GetReal, GetLongReal, GetString, SetBool, SetInt, SetReal, SetLongReal, SetString.  Links: added GetLink, SetLink.  Texts: added WriteObj.  Gadgets: added CopyPublicObject.  Desktops: added IsInMenu.<LI> The second and third parameter of Printer.Open was removed.  The username and password parameters were a leftover from older versions of Oberon and were never used.<LI> F3 & F4 can now be used in Draw to redraw or reset the draw window.<LI> ET4000 driver supporting many 256-colour video modes (Thanks Wolfgang Pircher & Wolgang Ibl).</UL>Errors fixed:<UL><LI> NetSystem.Text is missing (fixed).<LI> DInline does not work (found by Peter Ryser, fixed).<LI> The ISO-8859-1 button in the Mail.Panel Settings was not functional (fixed by Emil Zeller).<LI> FTP.Open ignores the passwords file (fixed by Emil Zeller).<LI> Netmask setting is ignored, gateway is always queried to get netmask (found by Alan Freed, fixed by Martin Gitsels).<LI> Miscellaneous.MakeUnixText & Miscellaneous.MakeAscii don't work (found by Peter Matthias, fixed).<LI> The German keyboard driver is selected by a D, not a G (found by Peter Matthias, fixed).<LI> "a, "u, "o are not mapped correctly with the German keyboard, they appear capital, "A, "O, "U don't appear (found by Peter Matthias, fixed).<LI> Backup.InitDOS Label labels the Disk LXXXX (found by Peter Matthias, fixed).<LI> Backup.ReadFiles doesn't read files starting with a number  from a DOS Disk (found by Peter Matthias, documented).<LI> When adding a package to an existing system, the Install program would corrupt the first existing file on the disk.  If all packages are installed to a new file system (as most people did) the problem does not occur.  (found by Peter Matthias, fixed).<LI> Clicking on the hyperlinks in Net.Text causes a stack overflow, which causes a reboot (Found by Chuck Thacker).  To fix it, make the following changes to Oberon.Text in the "Gadgets.Documents" section:  delete the 2 entries "file = HTTPDocs.NewDoc;" and "mci = MCI.NewDoc;" and add the 3 entries "file = HyperDocs.NewDoc;", "mailserver = Mail.NewDoc;" and "gif = RembrandtDocs.NewDoc;" (fixed).<LI> Some .Books are missing (found by Peter Matthias, fixed).<LI> The Molecules function of the Backdrops tool had a small error (found by Patrik Reali, fixed).<LI> BooksUser.Panel is damaged (found by F.Necati Ecevit, fixed).<LI> On 256-colour displays, only the first 16 palette entries were initialised.  The F5-F7 keys only worked with the first 16 palette entries (fixed).<LI> Simulator.Panel & PhonePad.Panel are missing (found by Prof. Gutknecht, fixed).<LI> Sisiphus does not work (fixed).<LI> 1-bit pictures don't work (found by Peter Matthias, fixed).<LI> Stack overflows cause a reboot (fixed).<LI> There is a problem with LONGREAL.
